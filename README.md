#MANCALA
by Jerry Brown Lee

##Introduction
Mancala is a family of board games played around the world, sometimes called "sowing" games, or "count-and-capture" games, which describes the gameplay. The word mancala (منقلة) comes from the Arabic word naqala (نقلة) meaning literally "to move". No one game exists with the name mancala; the name is a classification or type of game.

##General Gameplay
Most mancala games share a common general game play. Players begin by placing a certain number of seeds, prescribed for the particular game, in each of the pits on the game board. A player may count their stones to plot the game. A turn consists of removing all seeds from a pit, "sowing" the seeds (placing one in each of the following pits in sequence) and capturing based on the state of board. This leads to the English phrase "count and capture" sometimes used to describe the gameplay. Although the details differ greatly, this general sequence applies to all games.

##Mancala Rules

1. The Mancala 'board' is made up of two rows of six holes, or pods, each.
2. Each player has a 'mancala' to the right side of the Mancala board.
3. Four "stones" are placed in each of the 12 pods.
4. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on his/her side.
5. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out.
6. If the player deposits the last stone into his/her own mancala, he/she gains another turn.
7. If the player deposits the last stone into an empty pod on his/her own side, he/she "captures" the pod opposite to it. When the player "captures" the pod, all stones in both pods go to the player's mancala.
8. When one player's side of pods are all empty, the game is over.
9. All stones on your side of the board goes to your mancala.
10. The player with more stones in his/her mancala at the end of the game is the winner.

##Going Forward
1. Create a start screen.
2. Personalize gameplay by allowing players to input name.
3. Replace numbers with pebbles/stones.
4. Animate movement of pebbles/stones when moved into pods/mancalas.
